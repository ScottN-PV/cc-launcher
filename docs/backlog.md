# Backlog

The following ideas are potential future enhancements. Update or prune this list as priorities change.

- **Launch automation toggle** – Reintroduce an option that launches Claude Code automatically using `TerminalManager.launch_claude_code`, in addition to the copy-only workflow.
- **MCP import/export tooling** – Build an import dialog for JSON-based MCP configurations and allow exporting the current server set.
- **Server reordering** – Enable drag-and-drop or ordering controls within the MCP server list.
- **Session management UI** – Surface active sessions from `TerminalManager` in the interface with controls to terminate them.
- **Network-aware validation improvements** – Provide clearer offline indicators and scheduled revalidation.
