# Backlog

The following ideas are potential future enhancements. Update or prune this list as priorities change.

- **MCP import/export tooling** – Build an import dialog for JSON-based MCP configurations and allow exporting the current server set
- **Server reordering** – Enable drag-and-drop or ordering controls within the MCP server list
- **Network-aware validation improvements** – Provide clearer offline indicators and scheduled revalidation
- **Enhanced cross-platform testing** – Expand automated test coverage for platform-specific behaviors
- **Package as standalone application** – Create distributable binaries using PyInstaller or similar for each platform
